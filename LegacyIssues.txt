Reconsider implementation of attack method, can we generalize?

Merchant
Should there be an attacked method?

Character
Finish races (shade will be finished first)
Add support for reading stats from a file
	- There would be issues if we can't load stats from MIL
	- Child class (Player or NPC) defines stats
	- Before Child class constructor runs, we rely on Parent (Character) class' constructor to use stats to define initial health
	- The only way for Child class to define stats before Parent constructor runs is through MIL, or refactoring with new methods, resetStats()
